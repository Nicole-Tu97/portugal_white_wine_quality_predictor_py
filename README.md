Use Summary part from the report

The two datasets  used in this project are related to red and white vinho verde wine samples from the north of Portugal created By P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, Fernando Almeida, Telmo Matos, J. Reis. 2009. The two datasets were sourced from  website for downloading these datasets is the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
