## Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

If anyone engage in an unacceptable behaviour, we will take any actions needed including private meeting with the member to understand the situation, and consulting with our professor, Tiffany Timbers.

## Proceduce for Reporting and Dealing with Unacceptable Behaviour

Should you feel you were treated unethically, you should consult with other group member to talk about the case. The member who was consulted is to set up a meeting of 3 members (Member who were treated unethically, member who treated them unethically, and the member who was consulted) to better understand what was happening. If this meeting doesn't solve the issue, all of the members are to consult our professor, Tiffany Timbers.
